[{"research": [{"id": 1, "title": "Modeling Vulnerabilities", "description": " In order to protect user information and provide robust network operation, a network designer must know what types of attacks to protect against and what threats the network must be robust against. Hence, a necessary prerequisite to robust protocol design is to model network vulnerabilities and the impact of malicious attacks on the network. Protecting the information exchange between users is a problem that is well studied in cryptography, but the introduction of an entire network of users into the scenario introduces additional vulnerabilities when the information security is jointly considered with network protocols such as routing and multiple access. Furthermore, the propagation of information throughout a large network allows a locally-constrained adversary to have a more significant impact on information and network security, as the effects of the adversary's attack can quickly spread beyond the local neighborhood. We have investigated vulnerabilities in large-scale networks due to node capture attacks, in which an adversary physically compromises nodes in the network to extract secret information and gain network presence, and jamming attacks, in which an adversary intentionally interferes with wireless communication in the network to prevent information access and transport.", "type": "Emerging Wireless Networks", "link": null}, {"id": 2, "title": "Secure Localization", "description": "Wireless sensor networks, which represent a basic tenet of what we call ubiquitous computing, are now or will soon be deployed in physical environments that are vulnerable not only to the vicissitudes of nature but also to acts that could be easily viewed as hostile attacks by potent adversaries. Indeed, unattended operation of sensor-network nodes in hostile environments requires that we rethink the definition of our adversary, its capabilities and modes of attack. There are few problems of wireless sensor network design and analysis that areas challenging as localization and time synchronization. Yet both are fundamental building blocks not just for new applications and but also security services themselves. The natural interplay between space and time measurements and bounds, which are basic to both localization and time synchronization, produces a largely uncharted research territory. And, of course, the new capabilities and attack modes of the new adversary complicates the landscape in unanticipated ways. We developed robust location estimation approach called SeRLoc for wireless sensor networks that need to operate in hostile environments. We also developed a high resolution version of the localization. This work has eventually led to technology transition to Navy. We also organized a workshop and edited a book in this area. Applications of secure location estimation include relative location estimation, building and infrastructure health monitoring, location verification in cognitive radios.", "type": "Emerging Wireless Networks", "link": null}, {"id": 3, "title": "Network Performance Analysis", "description": "One of the primary tasks of wireless sensor networks is to monitor a Field of Interest (FoI). The availability of observations is directly related to the number of sensors able to sense a particular event, and can be quantified by computing the fraction of the FoI covered by at least a threshold number of sensors, also know as k-coverage. Previous work on evaluating the k-coverage, assumed that sensors have identical sensing areas and/or conform to the idealized unit disk model. However, we consider sensors of multiple sensing modalities such as acoustic, optical, infrared, CCD, magnetic, or thermal, have sensing areas significantly different than the unit disk model and may be concurrently deployed, thus forming a heterogeneous WSN. Alternatively, for applications such as area surveillance and habitat monitoring the network performance is related on how well the deployed network can monitor mobile targets that cross the FoI. We quantify the latter by computing the probability of detecting a target crossing the FoI. As in the case of k-coverage, analytically computing the target detection probability assuming a heterogeneous WSN is a challenging problem.", "type": "Emerging Wireless Networks", "link": null}, {"id": 4, "title": "Energy-Aware Secure Group Communications in Wireless/Sensor networks", "description": "We address the problem of securing multicast communications in an energy-constrained ad-hoc network environment. Existing efficient key distribution schemes for wired networks that rely on logical hierarchies are extremely energy inefficient for energy-constrained wireless ad-hoc networks. The joint consideration of routing and physical layer algorithms is critical for developing energy-efficient key distribution schemes. By formulating the problem we showed that solution is hard to compute. Therefore we developed greedy, routing-aware key-distribution algorithms that are easy to compute.", "type": "Emerging Wireless Networks", "link": null}, {"id": 5, "title": "Vehicular Network Security", "description": "The Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is an emerging wireless network that provides easy access to the vehicular communications, allowing eavesdroppers to estimate vehicle locations based on communication signal properties, such as signal strength. Therefore, the successful deployment of  VANET infrastructure, such as the US Department of Transportation Vehicle-Infrastructure-Integration project, cannot be realized without addressing the security and privacy challenges. We showed that the requirements of VANET applications and the restricted mobility properties allow vehicles to be continually tracked, and that the location tracking of a target vehicle can lead to the compromise of privacy of the user in that vehicle. Based on observed properties of mobile nodes in VANET, such as the group navigation of vehicles and the uncertainty of vehicle movement when merging/changing lanes, we proposed defense mechanisms that can protect privacy of vehicle users.

For electronic health records (EHR), privacy is ensured by restricting the access to authorized users only at any time. Following the HIPAA, efforts have been devoted to studying problems of controlling the access to EHR and ensuring confidentiality during the retrieval from a database. We identified that there was a patient privacy vulnerability that was not addressed by HIPAA and by any of the prior work in EHR. We showed that the authorized users can illegally distribute EHR to unauthorized parties, after reception of the EHR. We then developed methods for enhancing post-reception privacy of EHR by enabling tracing medical images in a multi-user communication environment. Using our proposed fingerprinting techniques, the source of an illegal EHR leakage can be identified in a resource-efficient way. Our scheme is highly robust to typical medical image processing and collusion attacks, while yielding high quality watermarked images.

However, as e-enabled airplanes connect with network environments off-board, vulnerabilities in open networks and use of commercial-off-the-shelf IT components present opportunities for security attacks. Some airplane loadable software, e.g. flight control computer software, have safety implications and the integrity of such safety-critical parts must be protected at all times. On the other hand, the integrity of the non-safety-critical airplane software also needs to be protected to ensure passenger comfort and confidence on airline business processes, and to reduce unwarranted flight delays. Based on a generic heterogeneous system for electronic storage and distribution of airplane software, we identified security threats to airplane safety and operation and maintenance and proposed security primitives to address them. This research is conducted in collaboration with Boeing Phantom Works and is a Boeing initiative towards becoming part of standardization efforts in the aviation industry.

However, the use of insecure Internet, well documented cases of incorrect implementations, and the resulting security breaches reported recently have significantly lowered public confidence in the security, reliability and privacy of e-voting. Although e-voting schemes have been developed over the last two and a half decades, their requirements are seen to be conflicting and there is no existing framework under which they can be studied and compared. In order to streamline the ongoing effort to improve public confidence in e-voting, we proposed such a framework that shows which requirements can be simultaneously satisfied by different classes of e-voting schemes, allowing designers to check the conditions their proposed schemes satisfy and the tradeoffs, thus reducing unwarranted claims or unintended errors. We have illustrated the use of our framework by analyzing some of the existing e-voting schemes. Furthermore, we have also proposed a framework for understanding Mixnets that are designed to use multi-stage cryptography and permutation to protect communicated electronic voting results as well as other types of user information such as medical records and personal opinions.", "type": "Industrial and Societal Applications", "link": null}, {"id": 9, "title": "Internet Security Standards", "description": "Cipher Block Chaining MAC (CBC-MAC) that was recommended by the National Institute for Standards and Technologies (NIST) for block cipher modes of operation is known to have security weaknesses.

We have studied point-to-multipoint or the single sender- multiple receiver model of secure multicast and developed analytical tools for design and analysis of the secure multicast. In particular, we showed that tree-based key distributions can be analyzed using well founded results from Information Theory and showed that the average number of cryptographic keys to be stored by a user in such a system is characterized by the entropy of member key update process under member deletion (which also includes the voluntary de-registration of a member).

Threshold schemes find vast application in collective control, threshold cryptography, distributed secret key storage, file sharing etc. Our research focuses on how to maintain the threshold via public broadcast channel when disenrolling untrustworthy participants, i.e., threshold schemes with disenrollment capability (first defined by Blakley et al). We showed that the original definition has a potential problem of rendering the dealer no control over disenrollment, and resolved the problem by proposing a more secure model of threshold scheme with disenrollment. We established a lower bound on the size of broadcast messages in the new model and study the tradeoff between share size and broadcast message size.", "type": "Internet", "link": null}]}, 200]

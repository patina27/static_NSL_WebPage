Compressing data naturally leads to the need for coding strategies that can represent the data in the most efficient way. This problem is studied in the context of optimal coding and the notion of optimality is introduced. The folk wisdom of twenty questions is brought back in this context and related to the Shannon-Fano-Elias coding. We will also deal with the correlated sources in which case the Slepian-Wolf Lemma provides the main result for compression.\n\nThe second part of the first course will deal with the results that relate to the communication channel and the rate of transmission in a given noisy channels. In particular, we shall derive the result dealing with the capacity of the channel followed by the rate distortion theory followed by the network information theory. Gaussian channel will be of special interest to us. Course wraps up with the joint source-channel results.", "link": "https://www2.ee.washington.edu/research/nsl/class/595/2003spr/"}, {"courseId": 9, "courseNumber": "EE 565", "courseTitle": "Computer Communication Networks I", "offeredQuarter": "Winter 2003", "description": "Introduction to computer networks, layered model, and network protocols.

				We are primarily interested in developing a concrete mathematical framework for bug-free algorithm design in security as well as in studying security protocols from communication, coding and information theoretic view points. We utilize tools from these well founded areas to design and analyze security protocols as well as identify bugs that may go undetected otherwise.

				<div class="description" id="postDescription_">
				 In order to protect user information and provide robust network operation, a network designer must know what types of attacks to protect against and what threats the network must be robust against. Hence, a necessary prerequisite to robust protocol design is to model network vulnerabilities and the impact of malicious attacks on the network. Protecting the information exchange between users is a problem that is well studied in cryptography, but the introduction of an entire network of users into the scenario introduces additional vulnerabilities when the information security is jointly considered with network protocols such as routing and multiple access. Furthermore, the propagation of information throughout a large network allows a locally-constrained adversary to have a more significant impact on information and network security, as the effects of the adversary's attack can quickly spread beyond the local neighborhood. We have investigated vulnerabilities in large-scale networks due to node capture attacks, in which an adversary physically compromises nodes in the network to extract secret information and gain network presence, and jamming attacks, in which an adversary intentionally interferes with wireless communication in the network to prevent information access and transport.

				<div class="description" id="postDescription_odd">
				 Wireless sensor networks, which represent a basic tenet of what we call ubiquitous computing, are now or will soon be deployed in physical environments that are vulnerable not only to the vicissitudes of nature but also to acts that could be easily viewed as hostile attacks by potent adversaries. Indeed, unattended operation of sensor-network nodes in hostile environments requires that we rethink the definition of our adversary, its capabilities and modes of attack. There are few problems of wireless sensor network design and analysis that areas challenging as localization and time synchronization. Yet both are fundamental building blocks not just for new applications and but also security services themselves. The natural interplay between space and time measurements and bounds, which are basic to both localization and time synchronization, produces a largely uncharted research territory. And, of course, the new capabilities and attack modes of the new adversary complicates the landscape in unanticipated ways. We developed robust location estimation approach called SeRLoc for wireless sensor networks that need to operate in hostile environments. We also developed a high resolution version of the localization. This work has eventually led to technology transition to Navy. We also organized a workshop and edited a book in this area. Applications of secure location estimation include relative location estimation, building and infrastructure health monitoring, location verification in cognitive radios.

				<div class="Titles" id="researchTitle_">Network Performance Analysis</div>
				<div class="description" id="postDescription_">
				 One of the primary tasks of wireless sensor networks is to monitor a Field of Interest (FoI). The availability of observations is directly related to the number of sensors able to sense a particular event, and can be quantified by computing the fraction of the FoI covered by at least a threshold number of sensors, also know as k-coverage. Previous work on evaluating the k-coverage, assumed that sensors have identical sensing areas and/or conform to the idealized unit disk model. However, we consider sensors of multiple sensing modalities such as acoustic, optical, infrared, CCD, magnetic, or thermal, have sensing areas significantly different than the unit disk model and may be concurrently deployed, thus forming a heterogeneous WSN. Alternatively, for applications such as area surveillance and habitat monitoring the network performance is related on how well the deployed network can monitor mobile targets that cross the FoI. We quantify the latter by computing the probability of detecting a target crossing the FoI. As in the case of k-coverage, analytically computing the target detection probability assuming a heterogeneous WSN is a challenging problem.

				<div class="description" id="postDescription_odd">
				We address the problem of securing multicast communications in an energy-constrained ad-hoc network environment. Existing efficient key distribution schemes for wired networks that rely on logical hierarchies are extremely energy inefficient for energy-constrained wireless ad-hoc networks. The joint consideration of routing and physical layer algorithms is critical for developing energy-efficient key distribution schemes. By formulating the problem we showed that solution is hard to compute. Therefore we developed greedy, routing-aware key-distribution algorithms that are easy to compute.

				<div class="description" id="postDescription_">
				 The Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is an emerging wireless network that provides easy access to the vehicular communications, allowing eavesdroppers to estimate vehicle locations based on communication signal properties, such as signal strength. Therefore, the successful deployment of  VANET infrastructure, such as the US Department of Transportation Vehicle-Infrastructure-Integration project, cannot be realized without addressing the security and privacy challenges. We showed that the requirements of VANET applications and the restricted mobility properties allow vehicles to be continually tracked, and that the location tracking of a target vehicle can lead to the compromise of privacy of the user in that vehicle. Based on observed properties of mobile nodes in VANET, such as the group navigation of vehicles and the uncertainty of vehicle movement when merging/changing lanes, we proposed defense mechanisms that can protect privacy of vehicle users. Our preliminary work was presented at the workshop on Embedded Security in Cars (ESCAR) 2005.
